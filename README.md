# HSCAGOA: Hybrid Sine Cosine Algorithm with Gazelle Optimization Algorithm

## Introduction
HSCAGOA is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that combines the **Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA)** for effective **exploration** with the **Gazelle Optimization Algorithm (GOA)** for refined **exploitation**, enhancing the balance between both for improved optimization performance.

## Features
- Hybridization of **SCA** and **GOA** for enhanced search efficiency.
- Improved **convergence speed** and **solution accuracy**.
- Robust performance on **CEC benchmark functions**.
- Suitable for **high-dimensional optimization problems**.

## Convergence Curves
The following convergence curves illustrate the performance of HSCAGOA compared to other optimization algorithms on benchmark functions:
